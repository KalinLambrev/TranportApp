# TransportApp
My first angular application


Thi—Å application uses Angular 6.2.4. The development is for a Company warehouse that facilitates suppliers by arranging routing with their deliveries to their respective customers.

1. The home page is a login where basic authorization is performed.

2. After successful authorization, the appropriate shipping and customer route is loaded with some details for the delivery items.

3. After selecting the wanted delivery items we can see the corresponding deliveries by customer criteria to see the approximate distance to the customer.

4 After delivering the delivery, it must be noted what exactly is delivered, a photo must be uploaded and the client must sign. Then the delivery is completed and the new delivery route is available.

Thanks for checking my code.
